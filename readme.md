# Additional Login Screen Project

### Main Idea

If you have been around my git you will see that I have been practicing making login pages for different baseball teams in New York.

I found that it is a good way to practice forms and to also make the webpage interactive.

It's a way for you to be able to pick my brain in regards to what I have been working on so far over the past month of learning code. 

### What's Next?

I'd like to add background images to both of these projects down the road. Also, I'd like to make sure that I use as little amount of CSS moving forward.

Making sure I add notes to my code is also of the utmost importance moving forward. I need it to be readable and understandable. I want you to know exactly what I was going for. 


### Issues?

Feel free to note issues or grammatical mistakes that you may find. Maybe the formatting could be easier read in another way? I'm always open to learn new ways of doing things.
